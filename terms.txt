Terms:

This bot will store your server ID and your server members ID's into a database upon first use. There is zero risk in ID's being shown, but I still want to make sure you know this is a feature for a lot of the bots features.
The bot is not online 24/7. If the bot goes offline, I am sorry of it comes at a bad time.

I am NOT able to overide permissions with this bot. I programmed the bot to even block me from using staff commands if I am in a server that I am not staff in. (Discord has a strict rule about this as well)

This bot undergoes constant updates and feature changes. If you feel this bot doesn't have many features, be patient, more will come in the future.

Feel free to give suggestions and tips on improving this discord bot!
