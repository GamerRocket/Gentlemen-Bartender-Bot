This discord bot is made to create a unique interface and have its own brand of features.
You can find many kinds of discord bots with moderation features, and these features are all forced onto your server without warning you, or they do things that you weren't expecting.
This bot is made to fix this issue.

Another thing I never saw discord bots do was has a functional multiplayer feature. This bot has this. I plan on adding more multiplayer AND single player games in the future.
I also plan on adding settings that disables and enables specific games so server owners have a little more control over the bot.

This bot is striving for trust, reliability, and originality. Yeah, there's so many discord bots out there, it's difficult to be original with some things, but I made sure I made my bot have its very own personality.

Thanks for reading! Be sure to read the bot installation guide!
